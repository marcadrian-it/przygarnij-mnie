# Lessons learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to learn and work with several new technologies. I deepened my knowledge of React by using hooks and the React Router. I also learned how to use Cloudinary for image and video management. Additionally, I gained experience with Mongoose. I learned how to use Redux Toolkit to manage the state of my application and Vite for faster and leaner development.
